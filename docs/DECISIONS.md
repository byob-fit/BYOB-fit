# BYOB-fit: Decision records

Status legend: FROZEN (approved by the owner in chat; date on each record, Sep 12, 2026 unless stated) · DEFAULT (proposed by Claude, stands unless the owner redirects) · PARKED (named, not in scope)

Each record: ID · Decision · Rationale · Consequence for build.

## D-001 App type: PWA (FROZEN)
Home-screen progressive web app, installed from a URL. Same class as an earlier single-file prototype. No app stores in v1.
Consequence: web manifest, service worker for offline shell, real-device acceptance on the owner's iPhone.

## D-002 Stack: React + Vite + IndexedDB (FROZEN)
React with Vite tooling; IndexedDB for all on-device data.
Consequence: no server, no accounts, no cloud database.

## D-003 Hosting: GitHub Pages, public repo (FROZEN)
Repo is open source. Nothing personal is ever committed: no program, no logs, no biometrics, no API key.
Consequence: personal data enters via a JSON import on first run; the seed file is gitignored; a generic sample program ships in the repo for anyone who forks it.

## D-004 Model access: direct browser call, bring your own key (FROZEN)
The app calls the Anthropic Messages API directly from the phone with the header `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true`. The key is entered once in Settings and stored on device only.
Rationale: verified in chat that Anthropic supports CORS for this pattern; GitHub Pages has no server to hold a key. A relay (Cloudflare Worker) is parked (D-020).
Consequence: once a week the log and goal leave the phone to Anthropic under the owner's own account.

## D-005 Default model: claude-sonnet-5, switchable (FROZEN)
Model string editable in Settings.

## D-006 Model jobs in v1: two only (FROZEN)
1. Write next week's program from the logged sets, the current program, and the goal.
2. Parse meal lines written in the owner's DFS-plus-delta convention into kcal and protein.
Nothing else calls the model.
Amended Sep 27, 2026: a third job, the AI review pass (D-026); meal parsing is local-first (D-032); every call is limited by the privacy level and shown in a preview first (D-031).

## D-007 Screens: six (FROZEN)
Today · Week · Exercise Log · Profile/Goal · Meals · Settings.
Amended Sep 27, 2026: onboarding (D-029), the program builder (D-028), and Settings sub-screens (privacy level, sent log, privacy page, safety notice) are added. The five bottom tabs are unchanged: Today, Week, Log, Meals, Profile.

## D-008 Today-to-deck interaction (FROZEN)
Today opens as a grouped checklist with a Start button. Start enters the deck: the active item is the large tile; the next item is a smaller tile below it, with a third, dimmer tile behind. Header shows section, item N of M, a progress bar, and a rest timer.

## D-009 Per-set logging with last-week defaults (FROZEN)
Main-work tiles log one row per set: weight and reps (or seconds, or distance, by item type). Each row shows last week's numbers for that set and pre-fills them; Done confirms defaults, typing only on change.

## D-010 How-to collapsed by default (FROZEN)
Each exercise carries a text description, shown on tap. No animations in v1 (D-018).

## D-011 Voice input: keyboard dictation plus parser (FROZEN)
Each set row accepts one free-text input that the app parses: "22.5 for 8", "22.5 x 8", "twenty two point five for eight", "same" (repeat last week), "45 seconds". Voice comes from the iOS keyboard mic key into that field. In-app mic is parked (D-019).
Rationale: single source states the Web Speech API works in iOS Safari but not in installed web apps; keyboard dictation is an OS feature and works anywhere.

## D-012 Units and week (FROZEN, carried from an earlier prototype's decisions)
Kilograms as the display unit, with the ability to record an item's load in lb where the equipment is labelled that way (the v10 program mixes both). Week starts Sunday.
Amended Sep 27, 2026: the display unit is the user's choice, set in onboarding (frame 1i) and Settings; each item's load keeps the unit it was recorded in, with no conversion. Week still starts Sunday.

## D-013 Day structure: sections, not a flat list (DEFAULT)
A day is an ordered list of sections. Section kinds: warmup, main, block (e.g. back block), abs, cardio, cooldown, daily. Items in main, block and abs are logged per set; cardio items log minutes plus a note; warmup, cooldown and daily items are check-off tiles.
Rationale: the v10 program has five to six sections per day; forcing them into one list would either lose structure or drown the lifts.

## D-014 Item types (DEFAULT)
load_reps · bodyweight_reps · timed_hold (seconds) · per_side (wraps any of the above with left/right) · distance (metres) · cardio_block (minutes, intensity note) · check (no data). Prescription fields: sets, rep range (min, max), hold seconds, tempo, rest seconds, RPE, notes, and optional per-program-week overrides (for staged items like the plyo progression).

## D-015 Week screen actions (DEFAULT)
View the seven days; swap two days (the program's Wed/Thu rule); mark a day done; see completion. Swaps are logged so the reprogramming call sees them.

## D-016 Weekly reprogramming gate (DEFAULT)
The model proposes next week's program as a full JSON program; the app shows a diff against the current week; the owner approves or edits before it becomes active. The model never writes to storage directly.
Superseded in part Sep 27, 2026 by D-025: the model returns a patch, not a full program, and the user approves all or discards; there is no edit step.

## D-017 Export and backup (DEFAULT)
Export everything (program, logs, profile, meals, settings minus key) as one JSON file via the share sheet. Export is the backup path regardless of iOS storage behaviour (see open item O-2).

## D-018 No animations, no external exercise dataset (FROZEN)
Descriptions are text supplied with the program. External libraries and animated demos are out of v1.
Superseded Sep 27, 2026 by D-033: visual demos are in scope, bundled with the app. No external exercise dataset is loaded at runtime.

## D-019 In-app microphone (PARKED)
Revisit after a real-device test of the Web Speech API in home-screen mode, or via an audio-to-text provider (would need a second key; not verified that the Anthropic key covers it).

## D-020 Relay server, accounts, app stores (PARKED)
Trigger to revisit: anyone other than the owner using the app without their own key.

## D-021 Private repo (PARKED)
Superseded by D-003 for this project; the earlier prototype's open question (Cloudflare Pages vs GitHub Pro) is unaffected.

## D-022 Client-side routing: HashRouter (FROZEN, Sep 14, 2026)
Routes live after `#` (`/BYOB-fit/#/week`). GitHub Pages has no SPA fallback, so a BrowserRouter deep link or a home-screen restore to `/week` returned GitHub's 404. Found by the executor after the Phase 2 deploy.

## D-023 byWeek overrides are cumulative (FROZEN, Sep 14, 2026)
For week W, every override with key <= W applies in ascending order on top of the base item, later keys overwriting earlier ones field by field. Replaces the Gate 2 wording "applies from that week onward until a higher key takes over", which the executor read as greatest-key-wins; the two readings diverged on one seed item (walk-jog logging from week 10). Chat and executor found it independently.

## D-024 Production approval is the merge (FROZEN, Sep 14, 2026)
The owner merging a pull request into `main` on GitHub is the explicit production approval PLAN section 6 refers to. The executor never merges and never needs to infer approval.

## D-025 Weekly update is a patch, approved whole (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026; records Phase 4 behaviour)
The model returns `{ week, overrides[], add[], remove[], notes }`, each change with a reason (EXEC-04 task 5). The app validates every id and field against the schema, shows one diff grouped by day, and offers Approve all or Discard. Invalid output is shown with its errors and never applied.
Rationale: EXEC-04 cited D-025 but the record was never committed; this writes it down as shipped.
Consequence: design frames 4f and 4g. Supersedes the D-016 wording.

## D-026 AI review pass: on request, line by line (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
Once a program and a goal both exist, a dismissible banner on Today and Week suggests a review (frames 4a, 4b); nothing runs until the user taps Review. The result lists each proposed change with a reason and its own Accept and Reject; nothing applies until "Apply accepted changes" (4c, 4d).
Rationale: a new or edited program deserves scrutiny per change; the weekly update (D-025) stays whole-patch because it is a routine adjustment. Never automatic because each call spends the user's money under their key.
Consequence: a third model job (amends D-006). Dismissing hides the banner for that program id.

## D-027 Update the program at any time (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
"Update program" on Week offers "Edit it myself" (the builder on the current program, D-028) or "Ask AI" (frames 4e to 4g). An AI update uses the sessions logged so far and applies from the next day not yet started, stated on the proposal ("Applies from Thursday").
Consequence: replaces v1's "Build next week" card. A mid-week update may change only items on days not yet started this week (as `byWeek` overrides keyed to the current week, which carry forward per D-023); validation rejects any change to a day already started.

## D-028 Program builder: one editor, two entry points (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
"Start a new program" (template or blank) and "Edit current program" open the same screens: settings, days, day editor, item editor, review (frames 2a to 2j). The draft persists across navigation until saved. Validation errors show inline on the field. An item with logged history is retired, never deleted: it gains `retiredFrom` and stays in the Log (2i). Item and exercise ids are never renamed or reused.
Consequence: schema v2 (D-035). Edit-in-place resolves the open builder question from the Sep 2026 handoff.

## D-029 Onboarding with a safety notice, not a questionnaire (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
First run is eight steps (frames 1a to 1l): welcome; two branching questions (follows a program, new or experienced); safety notice; program source (build with forms or import, or a starter template); goals; units; optional AI setup with privacy level; summary. Step 3 is a notice with exact approved wording and one button; the app stores only the acknowledgement time, never health answers.
Rationale: a questionnaire whose answers change nothing collects health data for no benefit and raised licensing questions about published screening forms.
Consequence: replaces Import as the first-run path; Import stays reachable. The notice is also reachable from Settings (5j).

## D-030 Structured goals (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
Goals are chosen, not typed: one main goal and up to two more from lose weight, lose body fat, build muscle, get stronger, improve cardio, general fitness; each with a relative target and unit; a timeframe of 4, 8, 12 or 16 weeks; ranked (frames 1f to 1h, 5a). Current weight and body fat are optional, stored on the phone and never sent to the model.
Consequence: new `goals` store. Resolves O-4 for goals; Profile's free label/value fields remain for anything else.

## D-031 AI privacy levels, send preview and sent log (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
Every model call sends only the fields allowed by the privacy level and opens a preview of exactly what will be sent (frames 4h, 4i). Minimal (default for everyone): program structure, exercises, sets, weights, reps, dates, structured goal, the user's rules text. Standard adds experience level and "felt off" notes. Full adds age range, sex and current weight, and free-text notes by opt-in. Never sent at any level: name, date of birth, body-stat history. Users who choose New in onboarding see a one-line suggestion to pick Standard; it is not pre-selected. Every call is recorded on the phone in a read-only sent log (5h).
Rationale: the maintainer receives nothing; what Anthropic receives is minimized and visible to the user before it leaves.
Consequence: amends D-006's "profile fields". Privacy level set in onboarding (1k) and Settings (5e).

## D-032 Meals: local first, calorie target on the phone, no meal plan (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
Meal lines that match the user's own baseline are parsed on the phone; only unmatched lines can be sent, through the send preview, or entered by hand (frames 3n to 3p). A daily calorie and protein target is calculated on the phone from the goal and never falls below a safe floor. The app does not prescribe meals.
Consequence: amends D-006 job 2. The formula and the floor are open item O-9 and must be sourced before the meals phase.

## D-033 Visual how-to, bundled (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
Every exercise can carry a demo (looping clip or image) stored with the app under `public/demos/` and referenced by path; nothing loads from another site. The text how-to stays underneath (frames 2d, 3b, 3c).
Consequence: supersedes D-018. Source and licensing of the media are open item O-6; until then the slot shows a placeholder.

## D-034 Visual direction 1b, light and dark (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
The whole app uses the 1b "ink and paper" direction: warm paper ground, open lists on hairlines, heavier headline type, one deep-navy accent, with a derived dark palette. Token values are in PLAN section 12.
Consequence: replaces the v1 FitIndex-style direction. Each screen adopts the 1b layout in the phase that rebuilds it; Phase 6 swaps colour tokens only.

## D-035 Program schema version 2 (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
Exercises gain optional `muscles`, `equipment`, `level` and `demo`; items gain optional `retiredFrom`. Import accepts schemaVersion 1 and 2 and stores 2; version 1 files need no changes.
Consequence: `docs/program.schema.json` v2; stored programs are upgraded when the database opens.

## D-036 Other people may use the app (FROZEN, Sep 27, 2026)
PLAN section 1's single-user scope is lifted: the app is built so a stranger can install it and use it with their own program and, optionally, their own key. Promotion to strangers waits on O-7.
Consequence: amends PLAN section 1. D-020 is unchanged: there is still no server and no account, and everyone brings their own key.

## D-037 Starter programs (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Three full-gym starter programs ship with the app under `public/templates/`: 3-day full body (beginner, 8 weeks), 4-day upper/lower (intermediate, 10 weeks), 5-day split (experienced, 12 weeks). Drafted by Claude and approved by the owner without changes. Design rules, sources and the coverage matrix are in `docs/STARTER-PROGRAMS.md`: every major muscle group trained at least twice a week, about 10 weekly sets per group in the intermediate and experienced programs, heavier compound work there, 8 to 12 reps for beginners (ACSM position stands 2026 and 2009).
Consequence: resolves O-8. Onboarding suggests the 3-day program for New and the 4-day program for Experienced. A home-equipment version is backlog B-9. Exercise how-to text stays DEFAULT until O-6.

## D-038 byWeek overrides are closed (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
An override may carry only `itemFields` properties; any other key is rejected by the schema. The same closed shape validates the `fields` of an AI update's overrides.
Rationale: found in Phase 6 verification. `itemFields` never closed its property list, so since Gate 2 an override, including one proposed by the model, could carry any key. The executor enforced the `retiredFrom` case in code; this closes the whole class in the contract.
Consequence: `docs/program.schema.json` corrected without a version change, because it only rejects keys that were never part of the format. Every stored and seed program must still validate; a file that fails is reported, never silently changed.

## D-039 Appearance: System, Light or Dark (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Settings gains an Appearance control with three choices: System (the default: follow the phone, as the app has since Phase 5), Light and Dark (override the phone for this app only). The choice is stored in `settings.appearance` and mirrored in `localStorage` only so the first paint uses the right colours before IndexedDB answers; IndexedDB stays the source of truth. The browser's `theme-color` follows the colours in use.
Rationale: stated by the owner, Sep 28, 2026. Omitted from briefs v2.0 and v2.1 and from the design canvas; the gap was Claude's.
Consequence: frame 5c has no Appearance row; the Phase 11 Settings rebuild places it directly under Units.

## D-040 Units in Settings change what comes next, never what exists (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Onboarding step 6 promises "You can change this in Settings"; Settings now has the Units control. Changing it sets the unit for new programs, new items, goals and body weight. The current program's items keep the unit they carry, and logged sets are never converted (D-012).
Rationale: switching an existing program's items from lb to kg would make last week's "60" pre-fill as 60 kg. Converting a program is a separate, explicit action, not a side effect of a setting (backlog B-10).
Consequence: the Units row carries the line "Applies to new programs and goals. Your current program keeps its units."

## D-041 The not-advice banner stays off onboarding (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
The per-load disclaimer banner (Phase 5) is not shown on `/welcome`, where step 3's safety notice already covers it. Everywhere else it behaves as before.

## D-042 Builder rules (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
These make D-028 buildable; each protects logged history or the user's time.
1. Drafts. One draft at a time, saved to the `meta` store under `builderDraft` on every change, so it survives navigation and reload. Save or Discard clears it. The draft is exported with the rest of `meta`.
2. Ids. New items, sections and exercises get generated ids that cannot collide with any id the program has ever used. Existing ids are never renamed or reused.
3. History. An item "has history" when any stored session has an entry with its `itemId`. Removing an item without history deletes it. Removing an item with history retires it (frame 2i): `retiredFrom` is today, or tomorrow if a session today already logged it.
4. Swapping the exercise of an item with history retires that item and adds a new item with the new exercise in the same position, so last week's numbers are never shown for a different exercise. Without history, the swap edits the item in place.
5. Editing the current program: `startDate` is read-only, because changing it would renumber every week and move every `byWeek` override; length cannot go below the current week. Existing `byWeek` overrides are kept exactly; the item editor edits the base item and says how many later-week changes exist.
6. Starting a new program saves it and makes it active; the previous program and all its sessions stay stored and visible in Log.
7. Exercise library for pickers: the exercises of the three starter programs and of every stored program, de-duplicated by id. Filters (same muscles, beginner friendly, no equipment) use `muscles`, `equipment` and `level`; exercises without that metadata appear only when no filter is on. Users can create an exercise: name required; how-to, muscles, equipment and level optional.
8. Session length on day cards and in review uses the formula recorded in `docs/STARTER-PROGRAMS.md` and is labeled "about".
9. Saving an unchanged program writes back a program whose JSON is identical to what was loaded.
Consequence: frames 2a to 2j; onboarding step 4 shows "Build it with forms" again (the Phase 7 limit ends), and choosing a starter program in onboarding shows frame 2a before step 5.

## D-043 How AI changes are applied (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Both AI jobs return the D-025 patch shape; they differ in where changes land.
1. Update (D-027, whole patch). For week N, a change to an item on a day not yet started this week is written as a `byWeek` override keyed N; a change to an item on a day already started is keyed N+1, so it takes effect next week (frame 4f: "Push picks them up on Monday"). Overrides carry forward under D-023. This replaces D-027's rule that changes to started days are rejected.
2. Review (D-026, line by line). Accepted changes edit the base program, because a review changes the program itself, not one week of it.
3. In both, a `remove` of an item with history retires it (D-042 rule 3) instead of deleting it, with `retiredFrom` the first date the change applies; a swap of an item with history follows D-042 rule 4. An `add` goes into the base program.
4. Validation errors name the offending key and item (for example `/overrides/2/fields/foo: unknown field "foo" on item i014`).

## D-044 What each privacy level sends (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Makes D-031 exact. One function builds both the preview (frames 4h, 4i) and the request, so the preview is what is sent.
- Minimal: the program without its top-level `notes`; confirmed sets (weights, reps, seconds, distance, minutes) with dates and ids; the structured goal (types, targets, timeframe, start date), never `currentStats`; the user's rules text.
- Standard: Minimal plus experience level and "felt off" flags (the flags exist from Phase 10).
- Full: Standard plus current weight from `currentStats`; and, only when the user switches on "Include notes", session notes and the program's `notes`. Age range and sex are listed in frame 5e but nothing collects them yet (O-11), so they are not sent.
- Never, at any level: name, date of birth, body-stat history, the Profile screen's free label and value fields, the API key.
Consequence: the weekly update no longer sends Profile fields. Anything the model needs from them goes into the rules text.

## D-045 The existing meals call goes behind the preview now (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Until Phase 10 makes meals local-first (D-032), the Phase 4 meal-parse call stays, but it opens the send preview and is written to the sent log like every other call.

## D-046 Calorie and protein target (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Computed on the phone and never sent at any privacy level. Method and sources in `docs/TARGETS-AND-PROGRESSION.md` Part 1: Mifflin-St Jeor resting energy; activity factor 1.53, 1.76 or 2.25 (FAO/WHO/UNU 2004); minus 500 kcal/day for lose goals, no change otherwise (2013 AHA/ACC/TOS); never below 1,200 kcal/day for women or 1,500 for men (same guideline); protein 1.6 g/kg, or 2.0 g/kg for lose goals (ISSN 2017). Calories rounded to 10, protein to 5 g, labeled as an estimate.
Inputs: height, age and sex are added to the goal setter as optional fields, stored on the phone and never sent (approved by the owner Sep 28, 2026). This is separate from O-11: the Full privacy level still does not send them. Without all three, Meals shows the protein target only.

## D-047 Progression suggestion (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
The deck suggests more weight only after two consecutive sessions of an item in which every working set reached `repMax` at the same weight (ACSM 2009: increase 2 to 10% after one to two reps over target on two consecutive sessions; the threshold is the owner's correction). Size 5% for exercises with legs, glutes, back or chest among their muscles on a barbell, machine or cable, 2.5% otherwise and when metadata is missing. Rounded to the nearest equipment step (barbell, machine, cable 2.5 kg or 5 lb; dumbbell 2 kg or 5 lb), never less than one step (nearest chosen by the owner Sep 28, 2026). If one step exceeds 10% of the load, the chip suggests more reps instead. An item may carry `progression` { sessions, percent, step } to replace the defaults. The chip never applies itself.
Consequence: schema v2 gains the optional item field `progression` (not overridable in `byWeek`). Frame 3b's copy becomes "Try <weight>, you hit <sets> × <reps> in your last <n> sessions."

## D-048 Felt off flags (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Each deck exercise can be marked Too easy, Too hard, or Discomfort (skipped), stored on the session entry as `feltOff`. Discomfort also marks the entry skipped. Flags are sent at Standard and Full (D-044) as item id and flag only.

## D-049 Meals on the phone: baseline foods and line grammar (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Makes D-032 and D-046 buildable.
1. Baseline foods. Settings holds a list of the user's own foods, each with a name, kcal and optional protein in grams (`settings.mealFoods`). The existing free-text baseline stays and is sent only with lines that need the model.
2. Line grammar, matched on the phone, case-insensitive with spaces collapsed: `<food>` or `BASE <food>` counts that food once; `ADD <food>` or `ADD <food> <n>` counts it n times; `SKIP <food>` subtracts it once. `<food>` must equal a baseline food's name. Any other line is unmatched.
3. Unmatched lines are listed under Needs AI, with "Send these lines" (the preview shows only those lines, the foods and the free-text baseline) or "Enter kcal myself". Each line's result records its source: phone, ai or manual. Today's total excludes lines still waiting.
4. Target details. The deficit and the 2.0 g/kg protein apply when the main goal (rank 1) is lose weight or lose body fat. Weight, height, age, sex and activity come from the goal setter's current stats; with no weight there is no target, and with weight but not all of height, age, sex and activity there is a protein target only.

## D-050 Release polish (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Closes the items parked during Phases 6 to 10B.
1. Sent log status. Entries keep being written before a call is sent (nothing is ever sent unlogged) and gain `status: 'sent' | 'failed'`, updated when the call returns; a failed row says so and shows the error. Entries without a status read as sent.
2. Backup reminder. When the setting is on and the last export is more than 30 days old (or there never was one), Today shows one dismissible note linking to Export. No notifications. Dismissing hides it until the next 30-day mark.
3. Privacy copy. Under current stats: weight "Sent only at the Full privacy level"; height, age, sex and activity "Never sent".
4. The privacy page (frame 5i) and the safety notice (frame 5j) are reachable from Settings, as D-029 requires; neither was built before this release. The safety notice text is the D-029 wording, unchanged.
5. The app shows its version in Settings (frame 5d) from `package.json`, set to 2.0.0 for this release.
6. The app icon is not redesigned in this release; it becomes backlog B-11, because no design exists for it.

## D-051 Weight and reps in separate boxes (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Found by the owner on their iPhone after Phase 11: the single free-text set field rejects "5, 135", "135, 5", "5 reps 135 lbs" and "135 lbs", and on a first session (no last-week reference) even a bare "5". Reproduced against `parseSet` on `main` (f0dd5d2). The grammar only accepts weight first with a connector word ("135 x 5", "135 for 5").
Decision (the owner's): every `load_reps` set row has two boxes, Weight (decimal keypad, with the unit shown) and Reps (number keypad). Last week's values show as placeholders; the progression chip fills Weight. A set saves when Reps holds a whole number of at least 1 and Weight holds a number of at least 0, typed or taken from its visible placeholder; an invalid box shows its error inline and nothing is saved. Other item types keep one box, now with a number keypad and the unit named: reps for `bodyweight_reps`, seconds for `timed_hold`, meters for `distance`, minutes for `cardio_block`. Number words from keyboard dictation ("sixty two point five") still read correctly in any box.
Consequence: supersedes D-011's single field and the dictation hint (frame 3b's "say 62.5 for 8"), which is removed. `parseSet` stays for "same" and for number words; its grammar no longer faces the user.

## D-052 No program after onboarding shows empty states (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026; records Phase 11 behaviour)
After onboarding, a missing program opens the tabs with the empty states of frames 7a and 7c instead of redirecting to Import; screens that need a program go to Today. Import stays reachable from Settings and Start a new program. Before onboarding, the app still goes to `/welcome`.
Rationale: an executor judgment call in Phase 11, accepted after verification because it follows the design. Amends PLAN 7.5.

## D-053 A pre-fill never becomes data without a real value and an explicit action (FROZEN, Sep 28, 2026)
Found in chat verification of small change 11.1, after it was merged (70109a3): on a first session, Done saved untouched rows from placeholders built from the prescription (the top of the rep range) and from the set above, recording sets never done, which could also trigger the progression chip.
1. Done saves an untouched row only from last week's reference for that row (its weight and reps). Rows without a reference stay empty.
2. With no last-week value, the Reps placeholder shows the rep range ("8–12") and cannot be confirmed; the tick needs typed reps ("Enter reps"). The Weight placeholder may still come from the set above, used only when the user types reps.
With rules 1 and 2 no prescription value can be saved, so the progression suggestion (D-047) sees only numbers the user typed or last week's real numbers. Amends D-051.

## D-054 Set boxes and the iOS keyboard (FROZEN, Sep 29, 2026)
Found by the owner on their iPhone after small change 11.2: focusing a set box offers "AutoFill Contact" with their name; on some exercises the focused row scrolls out of sight, leaving only the footer; a range placeholder is clipped ("15–2"). Checked in chat on `main` (ccd5696), in code and in headless Chromium (WebKit could not be installed in chat's sandbox; the default font there is not San Francisco, so pixel widths are approximate):
- Set boxes already use `type="text"` with `inputMode` and `autoComplete="off"`, and the app has no `<form>`. Those three levers were in place when the contact suggestion appeared.
- Collapsing the demo on focus does not push the row out of view without a keyboard: set 3 of 4 stayed at 328 to 380 px of 844, demo open or closed. The remaining causes need the iOS keyboard and are unverified.
- From 380 px wide the deck shows a 58 px last-week cell on every set row, empty on a first session. The Reps text space is 38 px at 390 px and 58 px at 430 and 440 px; "15–20" needs about 42 px. Below 380 px the cell is hidden and the text space is 64 px.
1. Every number box in the deck (set boxes and the cardio minutes box) carries a neutral `name` equal to its `id`, `autoComplete="off"`, `autoCorrect="off"`, `autoCapitalize="off"` and `spellCheck={false}`. No `autocomplete` value that names another purpose (such as `one-time-code`).
2. Focusing a box does not scroll at once. The deck waits for the visual viewport's next resize (the keyboard opening) or 350 ms, whichever comes first, then scrolls that set row to the centre of the visible area. Moving between boxes with the keyboard's arrows does the same.
3. While a set box has focus, the footer (Next tile, Back, Done) is not pinned to the bottom; it sits in normal flow.
4. While a set box has focus, a label naming it ("Set 3 · reps", with L or R on per-side rows) is pinned to the top of the visible area.
5. The last-week cell beside a set row is shown only when that row has last week's value for the same row (the reference D-053 saves from). A row without one has no cell and its boxes take the width. With that rule the Reps text space measured 64 to 92 px at every width from 375 to 440 px. The cell no longer shows the other side's value as a stand-in on per-side rows.
Rationale: rule 1 uses the last attribute levers; if the contact suggestion survives, a custom number pad (backlog B-12) is the next decision, not another attribute. Rules 2 to 4 act on the keyboard causes that could not be reproduced in chat; rule 4 keeps the set identifiable even if the scroll still misbehaves. Rule 5 fixes the clipping without changing D-053's range placeholder.
Consequence: small change 11.3. Acceptance is on the owner's iPhone; if rule 2 or 3 does not fix the scroll there, the next step is a temporary on-screen readout of the viewport values, not another guess.

## D-055 Add a set during a session (FROZEN, Sep 29, 2026)
Stated by the owner. Every logged exercise in the deck has "Add set". The new row is the next set number, for today only. It has no last-week value, so D-053 rule 2 applies: reps must be typed. The session summary lists added sets with "Keep in program"; the program changes only on that tap.
DEFAULT, settled in the 11.4 contract: the progression suggestion (D-047) looks only at the prescribed sets, so an added set neither blocks nor triggers it; an added set is stored and sent like any other set; "Keep in program" edits the base item under the builder rules (D-042).

## D-056 Add an exercise during a session (FROZEN, Sep 29, 2026)
Stated by the owner. Every deck page has "Add exercise", picking from the exercise library (D-042 rule 7). The exercise goes right after the current one, for today only, and is logged in today's session. The session summary offers "Keep in program", which adds it to that day of the base program in the same position.
Consequence: a session can hold an entry for an item the program does not contain. The stored shape, Log, export and AI payload (D-044) for such entries are settled in the Phase 12 contract.

## D-057 Edit logged sets (FROZEN, Sep 29, 2026)
Stated by the owner. While a session is open, a saved set is edited by going Back and retyping it; this already works (tested in chat on ccd5696: 100 × 8 saved, retyped to 105 × 8, then after Next and Back changed to 105 × 7; confirmed by the owner on their phone). After a session ends, Log's session detail allows editing a set's values.
DEFAULT, settled in the Phase 12 contract: an edit is typed and confirmed (D-053); an edited set becomes the last-week reference and counts for progression; the sent log is never rewritten, because it records what was sent at the time.

## D-058 Today's plan from inside the deck (DEFAULT, Sep 29, 2026)
Requested by the owner; shape proposed by Claude. The deck header opens a sheet listing today's sections and items with their done state, the same checklist Today shows; tapping an item moves the deck to it. No data changes.

## D-059 Week day detail and builder fixes (FROZEN, Sep 29, 2026)
Found by the owner on their iPhone; each reproduced in chat on `main` (11672a1) in headless Chromium unless stated.
1. The future-day detail's action sits above the tab bar. Measured at 390 px: the "Edit in builder" button spans 754 to 810 px and the tab bar 775 to 844 px, in front of it; a scripted tap on the button hit the tab bar. The dock uses the same bottom offset as Today's dock (`var(--tabbar-h)`), and the list's bottom padding clears dock and tab bar, so the last row scrolls fully into view. This day detail is the only screen with a tab bar and a fixed dock (class checked across the six tabbed routes).
2. The "As planned today" badge is removed from the future-day detail (the owner's choice). Future weeks on Week keep it, with the line "Updates to your program can change this week." The wording came from design brief v2, where it means "the plan as it stands today"; it never compared dates.
3. The day detail shows each item's `cue` under its name, as Today and the deck already do. Two warm-up items for the same exercise (such as two "Ramp sets") are told apart only by their cue. Whether the owner's own two ramp items carry cues is checked on their Mac, since their program is private.
4. The builder writes a draft only once the program differs from what the builder opened with. Opening and leaving without an edit leaves no draft; after the first edit, every change and step is saved as D-042 rule 1 says; Discard removes it. Reproduced: a fresh profile that opened the builder and left without an edit had a draft after a reload. The "Draft" pill shows only when a draft exists.
5. The length stepper's minus is disabled at the minimum, and plus at the maximum where one applies (52 weeks in the builder). The hint "You're in week N, so the minimum is N weeks." shows only when the length equals that minimum. Reproduced at week 8 of 12: the old hint showed at every length and minus stayed enabled, doing nothing at 8. The stepper is shared, so minus is also disabled at the minimum in onboarding goals and the item editor.
Consequence: small change 11.4. The top-of-screen blur (BUG-08) is not in it: it waits for a screenshot at rest (O-12).

## D-060 Do this today (FROZEN, Sep 29, 2026)
Stated by the owner. A future day in the current week can be done today.
1. The future-day detail's only action becomes "Do this today", replacing "Edit in builder". The builder stays reachable from Week's "Update program".
2. Any day of the current week may be brought to today, whatever the program's declared swap pairs (the owner's choice). Week's "Swap days" sheet keeps allowing declared pairs only (the owner's choice, Sep 29, 2026). Both apply the swap through the same function, which already drops any earlier swap touching either day.
3. A confirmation names both days before anything changes: "Swap Wed (Legs 2) with today (Pull)? Pull moves to Wed." Confirming applies the swap and opens the deck on the day brought forward. Cancel changes nothing.
4. If today already has logged sets, it is still allowed (the owner's choice), and the confirmation says so: today's workout stays logged under today, the day brought forward becomes a second workout today, and today's day moves to the other date, where it shows as done. Tested in chat on `main` (11672a1): with Monday's session finished and Monday swapped with Tuesday, Today offered Start on Tuesday's day, Week showed Monday's day on Tuesday as Done, and Log kept the logged set.
DEFAULT, settled in the 11.5 contract: the button does not show on rest days or on days in future weeks; if today is a rest day, a training day may still be brought to today; a started but unfinished session for today is ended as it stands when the swap is confirmed, as End does, so it cannot be resumed on the wrong date.

## D-061 The user controls the routine (FROZEN, Sep 30, 2026)
Stated by the owner: the user can do whatever they want with their routine. The app does not restrict order, sections, or which day is done when. Every contract is checked against this.
Consequence: D-015's restriction to the program's declared swap pairs ("the program's Wed/Thu rule") is lifted; declared pairs may be shown first as suggestions and never limit the choice (D-062).

## D-062 Day changes: swap and replace (FROZEN, Sep 30, 2026)
Supersedes D-060 rule 2 and the D-060 defaults on rest days and future weeks (the owner confirmed, Sep 30, 2026). D-060 rules 1, 3 and 4 and its default for an unfinished session carry over.
Swap (stated by the owner):
1. Any two days can be swapped: today with a future day, or two future days, in the current week or later weeks, including rest days. This applies to Week's "Swap days" sheet and the day detail's "Do this today".
2. A swap moves both days; nothing is lost or duplicated. Example: Push pulled from next Monday to this Friday sends Friday's Upper 2 to next Monday.
3. A future rest day can be brought to today: today becomes rest and today's day moves to that date.
4. The confirmation names both days and both dates before anything changes. Cancel changes nothing. Sets already logged today stay logged under today (D-060 rule 4).
5. DEFAULT: each day uses the byWeek values of the week it is done in.
Replace (stated by the owner):
6. Any date, today or future, can be given any day of the program from a list, including a day already done this week. The day it had is skipped on that date. The base program is unchanged.
7. Mid-workout, the deck offers Replace. Sets already logged stay logged under today.
8. DEFAULT: mid-workout Replace replaces only what is left of today; adding more is Add exercise (D-056).
9. DEFAULT: the list holds the active program's days only, until Phase 13 settles sessions holding items the program does not contain.
10. DEFAULT: a replaced date uses the byWeek values of the week it falls in.
11. DEFAULT: when one week holds two sessions of the same day, the later one is next week's reference (D-053) and progression input (D-047).
Model, checked in chat on `main` (40730de): a swap is stored as a pair of program days inside one program week, and each date's day comes from its weekday with that week's pairs applied (`dayForDate`). That can express any two days of one week, rest days included, but not a swap across weeks (rule 2's example) or a second session of a day in one week (rule 6). Both need an assignment per date ("this date does day X"), which also changes what the AI update is sent, last week's values, progression and export.
Consequence: all of swap, "Do this today" and Replace are built together in Phase 12 (the owner's choice, Sep 30, 2026). The small change 11.5 "Do this today" is cancelled. Acceptance, on the owner's iPhone: swap next Monday's Push with this Friday's Upper 2 and both move on Week; swap a future rest day to today and today shows rest; replace this Friday with Push, next Monday is still Push and Friday's Upper 2 shows skipped; replace mid-workout after two logged exercises, both stay in Log and only the rest of today changes; next week's Push shows Friday's numbers as last week's.

## D-063 Today's plan inside the deck, with reorder (FROZEN, Sep 30, 2026)
Amends D-058, which is now frozen in this form. Stated by the owner: mid-workout the user needs to see everything left, change the order, or stop.
1. A visible "Plan" control in the deck header, beside End.
2. The sheet lists today's sections and items, each marked done, current or upcoming, with its prescription.
3. Tapping any item moves the deck to it.
4. Any item not done can be moved to any position, across sections, by a drag handle or by Move up and Move down (the owner's choice, Sep 30, 2026; the buttons keep it usable with VoiceOver). Moving the current item later is allowed. Done items stay where they were logged.
5. The Next tile and the rest of the sequence follow the new order.
6. A new order is for today only. The session summary offers "Keep this order"; only that tap changes the program, section moves included, under the builder rules (D-042).
7. The sheet links to End, and to Replace once Phase 12 ships it.
8. Viewing, jumping and reordering change no set data.
9. DEFAULT: today's order is stored with the session, so a reload mid-workout keeps it.
The tab bar stays hidden in the deck; End is the way out.

## D-064 Set boxes on the device (FROZEN, Sep 30, 2026)
The owner's device check of small change 11.3, on the new build (the focus label showed):
1. The contact AutoFill bar still appears after every attribute in D-054 rule 1. No further attribute attempts. The bar is cosmetic: tapping its suggestion types the name into the box, and the box rejects it ("Enter a number, like 62.5"; "Enter a number, like 8", checked in chat on 40730de), so nothing is saved. The native keyboard and its dictation stay; backlog B-12 (in-app number pad) remains the only route to remove the bar.
2. DEFAULT: the focus label (D-054 rule 4) covered the first line of the not-advice banner. While a set box has focus the banner is hidden; it returns on blur.
3. "Enter reps" on a set ticked with nothing typed is D-053 rule 2 working, not a defect.

## D-065 Build rules for the plan sheet and Add set (DEFAULT, Sep 30, 2026)
Proposed by Claude for small change 11.5; each closes a gap D-055 or D-063 leaves open, checked against `main` (40730de).
1. Today's order is stored on the session as an optional list of item and section ids, written only when the user moves something. Items missing from the list (added to the program later) follow at their program position; ids no longer in today's deck are ignored. Export carries it with the session; the envelope version is unchanged because the field is optional.
2. An item moved to another section today keeps how it is logged. Whether an item takes sets depends on its section kind unless the item sets `logged` (`isLogged`), so a warm-up check moved into Main would otherwise turn into set entry. "Keep this order" writes `logged` explicitly on any moved item whose new section kind would change it.
3. After a reorder the current item stays current, except when the current item itself is moved later: then the item that takes its place becomes current (D-063 rule 4).
4. Done items cannot be moved; other items can be placed anywhere, including between done items. A section left empty for today is not shown.
5. "Add set" adds the next set number (an L and an R row on per-side items). The count of added sets is stored on the session entry so the rows survive a reload. An added row with nothing saved can be removed; a saved one cannot (edit it instead, D-057).
6. Added sets count for the progression suggestion like any set (D-055, the owner's choice): the existing check already reads every confirmed set (`src/lib/progression.ts`). They are sent to the AI like any set.
7. "Keep in program" for added sets raises the item's base `sets`. Weeks with their own `sets` override keep it exactly (D-042 rule 5), and the summary says so when the item has any.
8. "Keep in program" and "Keep this order" are not offered while a builder draft exists, because saving that draft later would overwrite them (one draft at a time, D-042 rule 1); the summary says to finish or discard the draft first.
9. The not-advice banner is hidden while a set box has focus (D-064 rule 2) through a flag on the document root, so the banner component itself does not change.

## D-066 Security hardening (FROZEN, Sep 30, 2026)
Asked for by the owner as general caution (Sep 30, 2026), scope chosen by them. Checked in chat on `main` (67ddd3d):
- `npm audit`: fast-uri 3.1.7 (moderate, GHSA-hrr3-gc8f-f4qj, shipped inside the schema validator) and brace-expansion 5.0.9 (high, development tools only). Neither is reachable in the app: fast-uri's flaw is in host comparison, and the app never decides where to send data from a parsed address. `npm audit fix` changes only `package-lock.json` (fast-uri 3.1.8, brace-expansion 5.0.12), leaves 0 findings, and keeps all 344 tests, lint and the build passing.
- No API key in the git history (only test placeholders such as `sk-ant-SECRET`); the private seed program was never committed; no raw HTML injection in `src/`; the app connects only to its own files and `https://api.anthropic.com`.
- A Content-Security-Policy on the production build stops the app from loading: Ajv compiles the program schema at runtime with `new Function`, which a policy without `'unsafe-eval'` refuses. With that one allowance added for the test, all eight main routes rendered, the inline theme script ran, a request to `api.anthropic.com` was allowed and a request to another host was refused.
- Precompiled ("standalone") Ajv validators contain no `new Function` and gave the same valid and invalid results as the runtime validator on the sample program and all three starters.
1. Dependencies: apply `npm audit fix` (lockfile only).
2. Validators: the program schema validators used by import (`importProgram`) and by AI updates (`reprogram`: item and closed item fields) are generated ahead of time by a script and committed; nothing compiles a schema in the browser. `npm run verify` fails if regenerating changes the committed file.
3. Content-Security-Policy, added to `index.html` at build time only (the dev server keeps working): `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'sha256-<hash of the inline theme script>'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://api.anthropic.com; worker-src 'self'; manifest-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'`. The hash is computed from the built file, so editing the inline script cannot silently break the page. `'unsafe-inline'` stays for styles because components set inline style attributes. No `'unsafe-eval'`.
4. GitHub Actions in `deploy.yml` are pinned to full commit SHAs, each with its tag in a comment.
5. `.github/dependabot.yml`: weekly checks for npm and GitHub Actions.
Known limits: GitHub Pages cannot send response headers, so protections that only work as headers (such as refusing to be framed by another site) are not available; the API key is stored unencrypted on the device by design (bring-your-own-key) and stays out of exports. Turning on Dependabot alerts and secret scanning in the repository's settings is the owner's step in GitHub, not a file.
Consequence: small change 11.6.

## D-067 Navy tab bar, a dependable End, quieter Dependabot (FROZEN, Oct 1, 2026)
1. Tab bar (the owner's choice, Oct 1, 2026). The tab bar was the page colour (`--tabbar-bg` and `--bg` both `#f5f2ec`, a 1:1 contrast), so users did not notice it. It becomes navy `#1f3a5f` in light and dark appearance. Active tab: white, bold, with a small white marker above its icon. Inactive tabs: `#bcc4cf` (white at 70% over the navy). Contrast, computed in chat: bar against the light page 10.3:1; bar against the dark page 1.6:1 (a hue change, with the top border kept); active label 11.5:1; inactive label 6.5:1.
2. End (found by the owner on their iPhone, Oct 1, 2026: tapping End beside Plan during a session did nothing; keyboard state unknown). Not reproduced in chat: on the live build (32b935e) in Chromium at 375, 390 and 430 px, with the rest timer running, End showed the "End this session?" box every time; the focus label has `pointer-events: none`; no hover rule applies. What chat did find: End's button is 40 px wide and touches Plan with no gap. Changes, aimed at causes that only the phone can show:
   a. Plan and End each get a tap area of at least 44 × 44 px with at least 8 px between them.
   b. End first takes focus off any set box (closing the keyboard), then shows its confirmation as a dialog over the screen, not as a block at the top of the page that depends on scrolling into view.
   c. With nothing left undone, End goes straight to the summary, as now.
   If End still does nothing on the phone, the next step is a screen recording, not another guess.
3. Dependabot (Claude's proposal, approved by the owner, Oct 1, 2026). Its first run opened nine pull requests, five of them major versions (TypeScript 7, @types/node 26, and four GitHub Actions). The config changes to: one grouped weekly pull request per ecosystem for minor and patch version updates; major version updates ignored for every dependency, to be planned as changes of their own. Per GitHub's documentation an ignore rule scoped by `update-types` applies only to version updates, so security updates still arrive; they need Dependabot security updates switched on in the repository's settings (the owner's step). The nine open pull requests are not merged as they stand.
Consequence: small change 11.7.

## D-068 Swap scope and exercise swap prescription (FROZEN, Oct 1, 2026)
Stated by the owner.
1. Swapping days stays as D-062 rule 1 says: today and future days only. A missed past day is moved with Replace (D-062 rule 6).
2. A mid-workout exercise swap keeps the original item's prescription today (found Oct 1, 2026: Walking swapped for Plank kept one minutes box). Exercises in the library carry no prescription; it lives on the program item. The swap will let the user set how the new exercise is logged for today (for example 3 × 45 s), filled from the exercise's prescription elsewhere in the program when there is one. It is built with Add exercise in Phase 13, because both store a prescription the program does not hold.

## D-069 Change a day, add and change exercises, edit from Log (FROZEN, Oct 1, 2026)
Approved by the owner, Oct 1, 2026, after the design was walked through in chat. Supersedes D-060 and the swap rules of D-062 (rules 1 to 5) and D-068 rule 1; carries D-062 rules 6 to 11 as Change; amends D-056 (where an added exercise comes from) and D-063 (empty sections).
Change (stated by the owner: "change instead of swap ... overwriting Friday's plan with Monday's"):
1. Any date from today on, in any week, can be changed to any day of the active program, rest days and days already done this week included. Nothing else moves: the other day keeps its own workout. Past dates cannot be changed.
2. A changed date shows its new workout and "Changed (was <day>)", with Restore, which puts its own workout back.
3. A future day's detail offers "Do this today", which changes today to that day's workout; the future day is unchanged.
4. If today already has logged sets, Change still works and its confirmation says so: what was logged stays under today, today's session ends as it stands (as End does), and the new workout starts as a second session today.
5. Mid-workout, the Plan sheet offers "Change today's workout", with the same rule 4 behaviour.
6. Week's "Swap days" sheet is removed. The builder's swap-partner control is hidden; `swappableWith` stays readable in the program file so older files import.
Model: one stored record per changed date (date, day id, when set). Dates without one follow their weekday as now. Checked in chat on `main` (691ddb7): converting today's weekly swap pairs into per-date changes gave the same day as the current code on all 21 dates checked per starter (two weeks with swaps, one without) for all three starters.
Exercises:
7. Add exercise lists the exercises of the active program, each with its day and prescription ("Plank · Thursday · 3 × 45 s"); an exercise on two days with different prescriptions appears twice. The added exercise goes right after the current one, for today only, with that prescription. "Keep in program" on the summary adds it to today's day at that position (D-056).
8. Swapping an exercise mid-workout asks how to log it today, filled from that exercise's prescription elsewhere in the program when there is one, otherwise from the item being swapped (D-068 rule 2).
9. An exercise added today or logged with a prescription of its own is stored on the entry with that prescription and marked added or changed. It is sent to the AI marked so, and a changed prescription does not count toward the program item's progression suggestion (D-047); it is still history for its exercise.
Edit from Log:
10. Logged sets can be edited from the exercise history in Log after the session has ended. An edit is typed and confirmed (D-053), records when it was made, becomes the next reference value (D-053) and counts for progression; the AI sees that it was edited. The sent log is never rewritten.
Sections:
11. The Plan sheet keeps a section emptied for the day as a drop target. Nothing removes a section from the program, including "Keep this order" (the owner, Oct 1, 2026).
Storage and export: the database moves to version 4 (weekly swap pairs converted to per-date changes, then the week-plan store removed); the export envelope moves to version 3 (day changes instead of week plans), and versions 1 and 2 still import, their swaps converted.
Consequence: Phase 12 (Phases 12 and 13 of PLAN v1.20 combined, the owner's choice): one contract and one draft pull request built as three commits (data, days, exercises), each with its tests.

## D-070 AI spending limit and usage (FROZEN, Oct 1, 2026)
Approved by the owner, Oct 1, 2026; built after Phase 12.
1. Settings explains setting a monthly spending limit in the Anthropic console, which is the authority, and links to it.
2. The app counts input and output tokens from each AI reply and shows this month's usage, with an estimated cost.
3. The estimate uses a per-model price table in Settings, filled with Anthropic's published prices for the selected model when the contract is written (verified then) and editable by the user.
4. The user can set a monthly budget in dollars; once the estimate reaches it, AI calls stop with a message saying why and how to raise it. Everything is labelled an estimate.
Consequence: small change 11.8.

## D-071 Progress graphs and body log (FROZEN, Oct 2, 2026)
Stated by the owner, Oct 2, 2026: Log shows progress as graphs; weight and other body parameters are captured; all body data is sent to the AI. Checked on `main` (d369117): Log has no charts (best set and date per exercise, week-against-week, per-exercise history), and bodyweight exists only as a goal value.
1. Graphs, drawn as inline SVG (no library, nothing the D-066 policy blocks): per exercise, estimated one-rep max per session; per exercise and per week in total, volume; bodyweight over time; each body measurement over time.
2. DEFAULT: estimated one-rep max uses the Epley formula, weight × (1 + reps ÷ 30), on the best set of each session; a single rep counts as its weight; sets above 12 reps are left out of the estimate, because rep-based estimates lose accuracy as reps rise. Volume is weight × reps summed over confirmed load sets, L and R rows each counted. Only load-and-reps items draw these two.
3. Body log: a dated entry with weight and optional measurements (waist, chest, hips, upper arm, thigh, body-fat %). One entry per date; a new entry for the same date replaces it. Weight uses the program's load unit; lengths use centimetres with kg and inches with lb (DEFAULT). Stored only on the phone and in exports.
4. Body data is sent to the AI in reviews and updates (the owner's choice), and appears in the send preview like everything else sent.
5. Integrations with Apple Health, smart scales, watches and Oura stay in backlog B-7 (the owner, Oct 2, 2026: "forget the ones I added for future now"). Findings recorded there: a web app cannot read Apple Health; Oura's API is OAuth only and needs a server, with sources disagreeing on when personal tokens ended (December 2025 or August 2026) and one source reporting that its June 2026 developer agreement restricts AI processing.

## D-072 Follow-ups from Phase 12 (FROZEN, Oct 2, 2026)
Approved by the owner as part of the pending work, Oct 2, 2026.
1. The welcome screen offers "Restore from a backup", which runs the same import as Settings → Import data without needing a program first.
2. The mid-workout exercise swap starts with "Same muscles" off. The builder's picker keeps its frame 2c behaviour.
3. Ending a session (the End dialog's "End session", or End with nothing left) marks it ended at that moment, so Log can edit it at once (D-069 rule 10); the summary and its Keep controls still work after that.

## D-073 How-to guide (FROZEN, Oct 2, 2026)
Placement stated by the owner, Oct 1, 2026: a guide in Profile and a "?" on key screens, no new tab. Text drafted by Claude for the owner to read in this record before the contract runs; the executor uses it word for word.
Links: Week's "?" opens "Changing a day"; the deck's "?" opens "Logging a workout"; Settings → AI's "?" opens "AI review and costs".
Guide text:
- Starting a workout. Today shows the day's plan. Tap Start, and the workout opens one exercise at a time.
- Logging a workout. Type weight and reps in the two boxes and tap ✓. Grey numbers are last time's values; tapping ✓ on an untouched box saves them, and reps you haven't done before must be typed. "+ Add set" adds a set for today. Back returns to an earlier exercise to fix a set.
- The Plan sheet. Tap Plan to see every exercise for today. Tap one to jump to it, drag or use the arrows to change the order, add an exercise from your plan, or change today's workout. "Keep this order" on the summary saves a new order to your program.
- Swapping an exercise. Tap Swap to log a different exercise today and choose how to log it. Your program stays the same.
- Changing a day. In Week, tap Change on today or any future date and pick another day's workout. Nothing else moves. Restore puts the date back. On a future day, "Do this today" brings that workout to today.
- Log and progress. Log shows each exercise's history and graphs of strength, volume, bodyweight and body measurements. Add a body entry from Log. Tap Edit on a set to fix it after a session has ended.
- AI review and costs. AI features use your own Anthropic key. Before anything is sent you see exactly what will go, including your body data. Set a monthly limit in the Anthropic console, and a budget in Settings; the app shows this month's estimated cost and stops calls at your budget. Use a key made only for this app.
- Backups. Your data lives only on this phone. Export it from Settings now and then, and keep the file somewhere safe. On a new phone, choose "Restore from a backup" on the welcome screen.

## D-074 Bug fixes from the owner's Oct 2 device use (FROZEN, Oct 2, 2026)
From the Oct 2 bug handoff, which the owner asked to fix (items NEW-1 to NEW-8; its device-check list is deferred). Checked in chat against `main` (d369117) before this record; where chat's finding differs from the handoff, chat's finding is written here.
1. Plan sheet moves (amends D-065 rule 3). An item moved to the current position or ahead of it becomes current; the item it replaced keeps its saved sets and shows as in progress. A move to a later position changes nothing on screen. Code: `currentAfterMove` keeps the current item unless the current item itself moved later.
2. Plan sheet scrolling after a move. In Chromium at 390 × 664 on a 12-item day the list was already bounded (267 px tall, 870 px of content, scrollable), so an unbounded list is not the cause there. The remaining suspect is the drag handle's pointer capture or drag state blocking touch scrolling on the next open; it is reproduced in WebKit with touch before any fix. Whatever reproduces is fixed; the list also gets `flex: 1; min-height: 0` so its bound does not depend on the browser.
3. Done during rest. When Done saves at least one new set, rest restarts at that moment with the finished exercise's rest; when it saves nothing new, the timer is left as it is. Code: `done()` saves and advances without touching the rest timer.
4. Session summary. The volume lines are removed: they sum weight × reps per item unit, and an item with no `unit` counts as kg (`session.ts` and the deck both default to kg), which mixed units for the owner (520 kg and 20,480 lb on Oct 2). In their place:
   a. "Compared with last week": counts of exercises Up, Same and Down, then one line per exercise that went up, such as "High-to-low cable fly: 120 lb × 10, last week 110 lb × 10". Each exercise's top set is compared with its top set in the last-week reference (rule 5): a heavier weight is up; the same weight with more reps is up; reps-only items compare reps; timed items compare seconds. An exercise with no comparable last-week entry is listed as New and not counted.
   b. "Ready to progress": exercises where the progression suggestion fires this session (D-047, D-055), with the suggestion.
   c. Kept: date, day, week, time, sets done, skipped, felt off, and the Keep controls.
5. Last-week reference. Code: the reference already matches the exercise, not just the item (`findReferenceEntry` looks for the same exercise on the same program day first, then on any day), so the handoff's "different exercise" cause is ruled out. The owner's "15 reps / 20 reps" with no weight on a load exercise therefore came from an entry of the same exercise logged without weight. The reference also requires a comparable entry: for a load-and-reps item, only an entry whose sets carry a weight; for other types, the same type. The executor traces the owner's case on an export they place on their Mac (never committed) and reports which entry supplied it.
6. Change on a finished day (amends D-069 rule 1). Change and Do this today are not offered on a date with a finished session; a logged session keeps the day it was logged under. Code: `canChangeDate` checks the date only.
7. Draft message on the summary. Code: Phase 12's Keep writes and Change a day build their program copy in memory (`loadDraft`); only the builder writes a stored draft. The likeliest source of the owner's message is a draft saved before small change 11.4, when opening the builder always saved one. The message gains "Open draft" (to the builder) and "Discard draft" (with a confirmation), and says which keep offers will appear once it is cleared. The executor checks that no Phase 12 action writes a stored draft.
8. Page pulled past its ends. Not reproducible off the phone. Fixes: `overscroll-behavior: none` on `html` and `body` (supported since Safari 16, but one report says installed web apps on iOS behave differently, so the phone decides), and the tab bar painted to the screen's bottom edge. The handoff's `env(safe-area-inset-*)` offsets are left out: they are zero unless the page sets `viewport-fit=cover`, which this app does not. Content blurred under the clock while the page is scrolled is iOS's own effect (O-12) and is not changed here.
Consequence: small change 11.8, as two commits (deck and summary; Week and app shell). Phase 13 moves after it.


## D-075 Finished dates and ending a session (FROZEN, Oct 2, 2026)
Approved by the owner, Oct 2, 2026. Checked in chat on `main` (5bbfcd7) and prototyped on a scratch branch (434 tests, lint, build and verify pass) before this record.
1. A date counts as finished only when a session of the workout it currently shows has ended (amends D-074 rule 6). An ended session of a workout the date was changed away from no longer hides Change, Restore or Do this today. Cause: `canChangeDate` checks for any ended session on the date, and a mid-workout Change ends the first session (D-069 rule 4), so since 11.8 a mid-workout Change left today with no Change and no Restore, against D-061.
2. DEFAULT: Restore to a workout whose session has ended makes the date finished again, so Change and Restore leave that date; the session's sets stay in Log.
3. D-072 rule 3 applies to every way into the summary: the last exercise finished, End with nothing left, the End dialog's "End session", and "End session" on the resume prompt (DEFAULT: D-072 named two of the four). Ending never creates a session when none is stored, and a session keeps its first end time: the summary's Done no longer moves it.
4. D-072 rule 2 is built as stated: the mid-workout swap opens with Same muscles off; the builder's picker keeps its frame 2c behaviour.
Consequence: small change 11.9, as two commits. D-072 rules 2 and 3 leave Phase 13.

## D-076 How-to guide built last (FROZEN, Oct 2, 2026)
Stated by the owner, Oct 2, 2026: D-073's placement stays (a guide in Profile and "?" links, no new tab); D-073's guide text becomes a draft. The guide is built last, after the design rework and the other Phase 13 items. Its text is then redrafted against the new screens and recorded as a new decision that supersedes D-073's text. If the rework removes or merges Week, the deck header or Settings > AI, the "?" placement is confirmed again with that text.
Consequence: the guide leaves Phase 13 and becomes its own step after it.

## D-077 Navigation: five tabs, always shown (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026)
Stated by the owner, Oct 2 and 3, 2026.
1. Tabs: Train, Meals, Body, Progress, Profile. Train holds two views, Today and Week (Today keeps Start, the deck, Plan and Change; Week keeps day changes and Do this today). Progress holds three views: Training, Nutrition and Body. The per-exercise history and set editing now in Log move to Progress > Training. Settings stays under Profile.
2. The tab bar is shown on every screen, including during a workout, so the user can check Progress or the week mid-session. It hides only while the keyboard is open (as the banner does, D-064).
3. While a workout is open and the user is elsewhere, a bar above the tabs shows the workout and any running rest timer; tapping it returns to the deck where the user left.
4. Leaving the deck loses nothing: the rest timer's end time and typed but unsaved set boxes persist and are restored on return. Checked on `main` (974ddbf): both live only in the deck screen's component state today (`restUntil` and `drafts` in `DeckScreen.tsx`).
Consequence: supersedes D-007's screen list and the five tabs of PLAN section 4 when the rework is built.

## D-078 Body log: InBody fields, tape measurements, BMR (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026; amends D-071 rule 3)
1. A body entry is dated and holds any of: weight; skeletal muscle mass; body fat mass; percent body fat; visceral fat level; BMR (kcal/day); waist, chest, hips, upper arm, thigh. Every field is optional, so a scale-only weigh-in is one field. One entry per date; a new entry for the same date replaces it (D-071 rule 3). Fields chosen to match the InBody result sheet's muscle-fat analysis and obesity analysis; InBody Score, ECW/TBW, segmental values and phase angle are left out (model-specific and slow to enter). Tape measurements kept (the owner, Oct 3, 2026).
2. Units: masses in the user's display unit (D-040); lengths in cm with kg and inches with lb (D-071 rule 3).
3. BMR (the owner, Oct 3, 2026): when an entered BMR is no more than 8 weeks old (MODELED), it replaces Mifflin-St Jeor as the resting energy in the calorie target (D-046 step 1). The same activity factor, goal adjustment and safety floor apply. Meals names which source the target used.
4. All body fields are sent to the AI in reviews, updates and period notes and shown in the send preview (D-071 rule 4).

## D-079 Meals: more nutrients, fibre target, limits (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026)
Approved by the owner, Oct 3, 2026. Sources and worked examples in `docs/SCORES.md` Part 4.
1. Each parsed line and day carries calories, protein, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, sodium, added sugars and saturated fat. Values supplied by the AI are labelled "AI estimate" wherever shown; baseline foods (D-049) gain the same optional fields, so foods the user defines stay on the phone.
2. Fibre target: 14 g per 1,000 kcal of the day's calorie target (National Academies Adequate Intake, checked at nap.edu Oct 3, 2026). Without a calorie target, the Adequate Intake by sex and age when both are entered; otherwise none. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2025–2030 were read first, as the owner asked: they give no numeric fibre target.
3. Limits shown against the day: sodium under 2,300 mg; saturated fat no more than 10% of logged calories; added sugars no more than 10 g per meal (DGA 2025–2030, read at cdn.realfood.gov/DGA.pdf Oct 3, 2026).
4. DEFAULT: the added-sugars limit applies to a group of lines the user labels as a meal; unlabelled lines show a daily total without a limit.
5. DEFAULT: limits are shown, not scored. The nutrition score keeps the four approved parts (D-080).
Consequence: meal records and the export gain fields (database and export versions set in the phase contract).

## D-080 Scores: training, nutrition, body (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026)
Approved by the owner, Oct 3, 2026, as drafted. Rules, weights, sources and worked examples in `docs/SCORES.md`, which is the contract.
1. Three separate scores, 0 to 100, per app week; never combined into one number.
2. Training: adherence 40%, completeness 30%, progression 30%. Nutrition: logging 25%, energy 35%, protein 25%, fibre 15%. Body: goal measures against the entry about four weeks earlier, with noise bands. Weights are MODELED and labelled as judgement calls on screen.
3. Safety: a day below the calorie floor never counts in range; an exercise skipped through Discomfort is not held against completeness; an ended empty session is not a finished workout.
4. Missing data is named on screen; its part drops out and the other weights scale up.
5. Open before the phase that builds the Body score: a noise band for weight (no source found), and a skeletal-muscle band (the 0.9 kg fat-free-mass figure is used as a labelled proxy until sourced).

## D-081 AI notes on a period (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026)
Stated by the owner, Oct 2, 2026; approved as drafted Oct 3, 2026.
1. Each Progress view (Training, Nutrition, Body) offers "Review this week". It sends that week's score, its parts and the underlying data at the user's privacy level (D-044), behind the send preview (D-031), and records the call in the sent log.
2. The reply is stored as a note on that week and shown with the score. Asking again adds a new note; earlier notes stay, newest first.
3. Calls count toward the monthly budget, and none are offered until usage and budget (D-070) are built.

## D-082 Design rework method and direction (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026)
Stated by the owner, Oct 2, 2026: layouts, flows and navigation may all change; the app should reach the standard of award-winning apps; the paper ground stays, every other colour is open; buttons and controls are to be redesigned if they fall short.
1. Chat's assessment of the current build (PR #34 tip, rendered at 390 px in light and dark, Oct 2, 2026): five button styles on one screen; heavy outlines on every set box; a navy tab bar heavier than the content; default system type; Log as an alphabetical list of mostly empty rows; the meal parser's grammar shown in a monospace box. Rated 5 of 10 against award-level apps.
2. Method: decisions and rules first in this chat (D-077 to D-081, SCORES.md), then design brief v3 for Claude Design, which explores two or three directions on two hero screens before the whole app. The approved canvas replaces `design/BYOB-fit_v2_design.dc.html` as the source of truth for layout and copy.
3. Kept: the paper ground (#f5f2ec light), 44 px touch targets, sentence case, no exclamation marks, light and dark for every frame, placeholder data only (the canvas is committed to a public repo).
4. Constraints the canvas must respect: fonts bundled with the app (the security policy allows `font-src 'self'` only; D-066), charts drawn as inline SVG, no remote images, one button hierarchy across the app.
5. D-018's "no animations" covered exercise demos and was superseded by D-033; interface motion is allowed and must respect the system's reduce-motion setting.

## D-083 Design v3 adopted, with corrections (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026)
The canvas `design/BYOB-fit_v3_design.html` (direction "Steady" with a navy tab bar, chosen by the owner in Claude Design) and its handoff notes `design/BYOB-fit_v3_README.md` replace the v2 canvas as the source of truth for layout, tokens and copy. Reviewed in chat Oct 3, 2026: 57 light frames and their dark versions, rendered offline. Corrections approved by the owner, Oct 3, 2026 ("all recommended"):
1. Swap (frame 2.10) is for today only, with the "how to log it today" prescription fields of D-069 rule 8 in place of the "Today only / Rest of program" control. Changing the program stays in the builder (D-042).
2. The session summary (2.12) shows the progression suggestion as text; the "Use 75 kg" and "Keep 72.5 kg" buttons are not built (D-047: the suggestion never applies itself, and program items store no weight).
3. Screens the canvas does not draw are restyled with the v3 tokens and components and keep their current layout: exercise history and set editing (now under Progress > Training, D-077 rule 1), the Settings sub-pages, the builder, the goal setter, import, the sent log, the privacy page and the foods list. The welcome screen (1a) gains a tertiary "Restore from a backup" under "Get started" (D-072 rule 1).
4. Muted text (#8a847a; 3.3:1 on the ground, measured in chat) is used only for non-essential text. Every other token pair measured in chat meets WCAG AA (lowest: dark tab label 4.9:1).
5. Fonts: Bricolage Grotesque and Atkinson Hyperlegible, both SIL OFL 1.1 (checked in Google Fonts' repository Oct 3, 2026), self-hosted as woff2 with their OFL texts. Instrument Sans appears only in the canvas's annotations and is not shipped.
6. DEFAULT: the tab bar shows on every screen inside the app, including the deck and Settings pages, but not on onboarding, import or the builder, which are full-screen flows with their own Back and Save.
7. The placeholder training score in brief v3 section 8 (76) is wrong for its own goal; SCORES.md gives 85. Chat's error; no code impact, because tests use SCORES.md's worked examples.

## D-084 Privacy levels kept; body data and scores sent at every level (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026; amends D-044)
Approved by the owner, Oct 3, 2026. The canvas's renamed levels (3.16: "Summaries only", "Summaries and foods", "Everything") are not built.
1. The levels stay Minimal, Standard and Full with D-044's contents. Frame 3.16's layout is used with D-044's names and descriptions. Onboarding 1k's Full line reads "Adds current weight" (age range and sex are never sent, O-11).
2. Every level also sends body entries (all D-078 fields, with dates; D-071 rule 4, the owner's choice) and, in a week review (D-081), that week's score and its parts. D-044's "never: body-stat history" is removed for body entries.
3. Still never sent, at any level: name, date of birth, height, age and sex (D-046), the Profile screen's free fields, the API key.
4. The meals estimate keeps sending only the unmatched lines and the user's saved foods (D-045).

## D-085 AI usage and budget, as built (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026; amends D-070)
1. Each AI reply's `usage.input_tokens` and `usage.output_tokens` are stored on its sent-log entry with the model used. A call that returns no usage counts as zero and is marked so.
2. The month is the calendar month in the phone's local time.
3. Default price table, per million tokens in / out, verified Oct 3, 2026 at platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing (unchanged from Oct 2): Sonnet 5 $2 / $10; Sonnet 5.5 $2 / $10; Haiku 4.5 $1 / $5; Opus 5.5 $4 / $20; Fable 5.1 $10 / $50. Rows are keyed by model string (`claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-sonnet-5-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-fable-5-1`; the strings other than the app's default come from Claude's product information, not the pricing page). Every row is editable. A model with no row shows its tokens with "No price set", and its cost is not counted.
4. Budget (frame 3.17): optional monthly amount in dollars, none by default. "Warn me at" a percentage, default 80%. "Stop sending at the budget", on by default once a budget is set (the owner accepted both, Oct 3, 2026). With the switch on, an AI action at or over the budget shows why and how to raise it, and sends nothing; with it off, a warning only.
5. Settings links to the Anthropic console's limits page (https://platform.claude.com/settings/limits) and advises a key made only for this app. Every cost is labelled an estimate.

## D-086 An ended session with nothing in it is discarded (FROZEN, Oct 3, 2026; amends D-075 rule 3)
Approved by the owner, Oct 3, 2026 (option 1). Found in chat's 11.9 verification: Start, then End with nothing logged, left today Done with no Change or Restore.
1. When a session ends by any path (the four summary paths of D-075 rule 3, a mid-workout Change, `endOpenSession`) and holds no confirmed set and no checked item, it is deleted instead of ended. The date stays open: Today shows the plan, and Change and Restore stay offered.
2. The summary then says "Nothing was logged" and its Done returns to Today.
3. D-080's rule that an empty session is not a finished workout stays, as a second guard.

## D-087 Identity: brand black, tab bar, wordmark and app icon (FROZEN, Oct 4, 2026)
Stated by the owner, Oct 3 and 4, 2026: the navy tab bar did not look pleasing; matte black like the Apple TV logo in light mode, and a silver bar with black items in dark mode; the navy background and "B" icon looked plain; the logo is the stacked "BYOB" without a bar, drawn like the header's wordmark. All in one build with the fixes of D-088.
1. Palette roles. Brand pair: matte black #1D1D1F and the paper ground #F5F2EC. Sage stays the action and done colour. Navy (#1F3A5F light, #A9C2E6 dark) is kept only for AI marks (the AI tag, the AI banner, the onboarding AI tip), so AI stays distinct. Sources for the black: the Apple TV logo measures as pure black (#000000) in a logo database; #1D1D1F is listed as "Apple Black" by a brand-colour site; neither is an Apple publication. #1D1D1F chosen as the matte option (the owner, Oct 4, 2026).
2. Tab bar, light: #1D1D1F; active label #FDFCF9 (16.4:1), inactive #A1A1A6 (6.5:1). Dark: Apple grey #A2AAAD (listed as Pantone 429 C by the same brand-colour site); active label #000000 (8.9:1), inactive #3A3A3C (4.8:1), and a white pill behind the active tab. The pill is 2.4:1 against the bar, below the 3:1 non-text guideline on its own; the active state is also carried by the bold black label, so it is not the only signal. Contrast computed in chat, Oct 4, 2026.
3. Wordmark: the header's "BY◯B" (the O drawn as a weight plate) in ink (#1D1D1F light, #ECEBE6 dark) instead of navy; "-fit" stays sage.
4. App icon: "BY" over "◯B", the plate drawn as in the wordmark but at letter height so the two lines balance, in paper on #1D1D1F, no bar. Letters are outlines from the bundled Bricolage Grotesque at weight 800, width 78% (OFL 1.1), so the icon needs no font. Files: `public/icon.svg` (master, 512), `design/icon-maskable.svg` (master, glyph block 0.586 of the side, inside the maskable safe circle of radius 40%), `public/pwa-192.png`, `public/pwa-512.png`, `public/apple-touch-icon.png` (180), `public/pwa-maskable-192.png`, `public/pwa-maskable-512.png`. Rendered in chat Oct 4, 2026; hashes in PLAN's integrity table.
5. The manifest's `theme_color` and `background_color` become #1D1D1F (the splash matches the icon); the page's `theme-color` meta keeps following the ground per mode. The manifest's maskable entries point at the maskable files; the touch icon link points at `apple-touch-icon.png`.
6. Nothing in the icon or wordmark copies an Apple mark; only the colour is borrowed.
Consequence: amends D-083's tokens (README: tab bar #1f3a5f, brand navy) and D-082 rule 3.

## D-088 Fixes from Oct 4 device use (FROZEN, Oct 4, 2026)
Reported by the owner on the iPhone after Phase 13, Oct 4, 2026.
1. Add exercise on the tile. Before Phase 13 the exercise tile had "+ Add exercise" beside Swap (D-069 rule 7); the v3 canvas did not draw it and the rebuild dropped it, leaving only the Plan sheet's button. It is restored on the tile beside Swap (the owner's choice). Checked in chat: the Plan sheet's button exists, sits outside the scrolling list, and stays visible and tappable in Chromium with 12 exercises; whether it is cut off on the iPhone is unconfirmed, so the contract checks it in WebKit at 390 × 844 and 375 × 667.
2. Cardio minutes box. On the iPhone a cardio item at 24 minutes showed the "2" and about a quarter of the "4". Not reproduced in Chromium (the text measures 66 px in the 110 px box at 390 and 375 px). The contract reproduces it in WebKit first; the candidate fix (prototyped in chat, all tests pass) sizes the box in digit widths (3ch, no padding, tabular digits: 105 px, holding "120" at 84 px). If WebKit shows a different cause, that cause is fixed instead.

## D-089 Fixes from Oct 4 screenshots (FROZEN, Oct 5, 2026)
Reported by the owner on the iPhone, Oct 4, 2026, with three screenshots. Fixes prototyped and checked in chat on `main` (9b18f14), Chromium at 390 × 844; 702 tests pass with them.
1. Blank screen after Back. Opening an exercise from a searched, scrolled Progress list and going Back left a blank band with the content pushed down. Cause found in chat: no screen change manages the page position or the focused field (only the deck does), so a screen inherits the last one's position, and on iOS a search field still focused while its screen is replaced can leave the page shifted by the keyboard. Fix: on every screen change the focused field is released (closing the keyboard); going forward opens the new screen at the top; Back restores the position the screen was left at, waiting up to one second for it to load. Checked in Chromium: list at 254 px with the search focused; the exercise opened at 0 with focus released; Back returned to 254. Not testable off the iPhone: the device check decides.
2. Half-cut dot on "Top-set weight". The exercise page used an older chart that drew a single point at the box's edge (x 118 of 120, radius 3) and stretched it into an oval. It now uses the shared Progress chart, which centres a single point: checked, an 8 × 8 dot centred at 171 of 342 px, fully inside.
3. DEFAULT (proposed Oct 4, the owner gave no preference): a score starts at the user's first entry for it, and earlier dates are "Not started", not "Missed" (SCORES.md Part 1 rule 7). Without it, a tester's weeks before installing the app show as Missed and pull the training score trend down with zeros. The calendar shows those dates with a dashed outline and a "Not started" legend entry.
4. The tab bar comment in `src/ui/TabBar.tsx` that still said navy is corrected (D-087).
Not in this change: the "520 kg" unit display (Oct 2 handoff, not re-checked), bench sets on Sep 28 shown without a weight (unanswered: data or bug), and the cardio box at 24 minutes (fixed blind in 13.1, unconfirmed on the iPhone). The device session answers all three.

## D-090 Release to a focus group (FROZEN, Oct 5, 2026)
Stated by the owner, Oct 4 and 5, 2026.
1. Testers: 10 to 30 people the owner knows, on iPhone and Android.
2. Home: a new GitHub organisation, `byob-fit` (free on GitHub when checked Oct 4, 2026); the app at https://byob-fit.github.io/BYOB-fit/. GitHub's documentation gives a project site the address `<owner>.github.io/<repository>`, so the organisation is a separate origin from the personal-account origin the app used before. The organisation publishes no other Pages site (PLAN, hosting rule).
3. Move: transfer this repository, keeping its name, so commits, decisions, contracts, issues and pull requests move with it and the `/BYOB-fit/` path needs no code change. GitHub redirects git operations after a transfer but does not redirect the Pages site, so the owner exports a backup before the transfer and imports it on the new site after reinstalling.
4. Legal (O-7): no lawyer review before the focus group; the owner accepts the risk because the testers are people they know, and a clear notice replaces the review. The notice covers: data stays on the phone; not medical, dietary or training advice; AI outputs may be inaccurate (Anthropic's Commercial Terms require users to be told); each tester uses and pays for their own AI key; export backups regularly, since whether a phone keeps an installed app's data is unverified (O-2). O-7 stays open for any wider release.
5. Feedback: an email link in Profile to a dedicated address (not the owner's personal or work email), with the app version and phone type pre-filled in the subject.
6. Before invites: small change 13.2, the owner's device session (open gates for 11.9, 13, 13.1, 13.2 and the served-bytes checks), then a release contract: transfer, Pages on the new origin with served bytes and the security policy re-verified, the notice, the README, the how-to guide (13G), the feedback link, and at least one check on a real Android phone (none has been done).

## D-091 Copy to the organisation as a clean snapshot (FROZEN, Oct 5, 2026; amends D-090 rule 3)
Stated by the owner, Oct 5, 2026.
1. The code moves to `byob-fit/BYOB-fit` as a copy, not a transfer: one commit holding the tree of `main` at 2b87ff6 with the redactions of rule 2, and no earlier history. The previous repository keeps the full history, is made private after the owner's data has moved to the new site, and stays as the archive. Commit hashes and pull request numbers in these records before this decision refer to that archive; the new repository's numbering starts again.
2. No name or personal information in the new repository, the owner's choice. The owner is referred to as "the owner", with neutral pronouns; no personal names, account names, machine or network names, email addresses, health context or personal training schedule appear in any committed file. Applied in chat on a copy of 2b87ff6 and checked: a list of the owner's identifiers matched nothing except the licence line of rule 3, including inside the design canvases' embedded assets; the full test suite (722), lint and verify pass on the redacted tree. The identifier list is kept outside the repository, since it would itself name the owner; every future contract runs it before a commit.
3. Exception, the owner's choice: the licence's copyright line names the owner, followed by "and BYOB-fit contributors".
4. Pinned files changed by the redaction (two executor prompts, SCORES.md, TARGETS-AND-PROGRESSION.md, STARTER-PROGRAMS.md, the program schema and its generated validators) carry new hashes in PLAN's table, marked as redacted under this decision. The schema's `$id` now names `byob-fit/BYOB-fit`; it is an identifier, never fetched.
5. GitHub account: the owner keeps their own account as the organisation's owner and sets their membership to private; their account name will show on pushes and pull requests (accepted). Commits use the author name "BYOB-fit maintainers" and the address `noreply@byob-fit.invalid` (the `.invalid` domain is reserved and names no one), so commit metadata carries no account name; the account still shows where GitHub records who pushed.
6. The owner's data moves by export and Restore from a backup on the new site, with the API key entered again (backups never carry it). The old site keeps working until the new one is checked, then the old repository is made private.

## D-092 Timer for left/right holds, summary lists, text standards (FROZEN, Oct 8, 2026)
Reported by the owner on the iPhone, Oct 8, 2026 (a screen recording and a screenshot); rules 1 to 5 approved by the owner the same day. Built and checked in chat on `main` (f658b39): 724 tests, lint and verify pass; rules 1 to 4 were checked in Chromium at 390 × 844 under the D-066 policy on a left/right hold logged per set (left then right, a running box stopping on tap, the time kept when leaving mid-hold, no timer left running), and rule 6 by unit test.
1. A left/right hold runs one side at a time, left then right, set by set. The panel names the side ("Set 1, right side. Start when you’re in position."); "Stop and log" and "Log 30 s without the timer" act on that side. Cause found in code: the timer and the shortcut addressed the left side only, so the right side could never be timed.
2. At most one hold timer runs; starting one stops any other.
3. Nothing runs unseen. Saving a row whose hold is running logs the time held; tapping a running box or moving to another exercise stops the timer into the box as an unsaved, editable value; Done saves boxes as before, so it saves a running hold's time. Leaving the workout screen keeps the hold running and restores it, as the rest timer does (D-077 rule 4). Cause found in code: only "Stop and log" stopped a timer, so a finished set's timer kept counting into the next set and its box stayed locked.
4. Tapping a running box stops it and the box can be edited at once.
5. Focusing a set box scrolls once, without animation, and only when the row is hidden or its centre is below the midline; frame 4.09's position is kept. Cause, likely: the app's smooth scroll competed with the browser's own. The keyboard cannot be reproduced off the iPhone; the device check decides.
6. The session summary's Up, Same and Down tiles are buttons; each lists its exercises with this week's and last week's top set, Up first when it has any. Before, only exercises that went up were listed.
7. Text standards, the owner's choice: American English in all text users see (fiber, judgment, physical therapist); one apostrophe style (’); menu paths written "Settings → AI" and "Goals". Internal data names (such as `fibreG`) and the AI prompts are unchanged, so stored data, backups and the D-081 prompt stay as they are. Sixteen wording fixes, found by reading all 431 user-facing sentences, include "BYOB-fit does not give medical advice" (it said "is not medical advice") on the safety notice and the same correction on the banner. A dictionary check found no misspelled words.
8. The tester notice (D-090 rule 4), final wording approved by the owner Oct 8, 2026, with the same grammar correction: its second point reads "It doesn’t give medical, dietary or training advice", and its AI point reads "If you add your own Anthropic API key, your request and the data it needs are sent from your phone to Anthropic, billed to your key. Understand what data is sent: the app shows you exactly what will be sent before every AI request, and Settings lets you choose how much it includes. Treat AI answers as suggestions, not facts." Built by the release contract.
9. Dependency: a high-severity advisory for `source-map-js` (build tooling only, through Vite and PostCSS; not shipped to phones) is fixed by `npm audit fix` (1.2.1 to 1.2.2), run on the owner's Mac as its own commit, because chat's npm rewrites unrelated lockfile markers.
